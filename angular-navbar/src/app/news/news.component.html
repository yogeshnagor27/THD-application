        <!-- The Bavarian Ministry of Science, in agreement with the Bavarian Ministry of Finance and the Bavarian Ministry of Construction, 
        approved the project application for the new construction of the European Campus Rottal-Inn (ECRI). This laid the foundation stone 
        for the planning of the new campus building.

        At the announcement, Science Minister Sibler emphasised that it is thanks to the high quality of the Pfarrkirchen study location that 
        the Deggendorf Institute of Technology (DIT) is now getting a new home in Pfarrkirchen. “With this, we are creating a state-of-the-art 
        study environment for around a thousand students on an area of over 4,000 square metres. In particular, the new building will also provide 
        additional space for applied research and for the further expansion of the degree programmes in order to consistently continue this Lower 
        Bavarian model of success,” explained Sibler. The Ministry of Construction is also delighted. They are pleased about the order and will now begin 
        with the planning. The new ECRI building will create a state-of-the-art location. -->

        <!-- The Deggendorf Institute of Technology (DIT) has been working for several years to ensure that great business ideas from students do not simply 
        disappear into a drawer. Students who would like to set up their own business can rely on the university’s Startup Campus team and a network that 
        has grown considerably in the meantime. The university’s central information event is the Start-up Day. This year, it took place on 18 November as
         a virtual event.

In several lectures more than 180 participants got to know the contact people of the university, the Hans Lindner Foundation, the Digitalisation Start-up 
Centre Lower Bavaria and the Digital Start-up Centre Rottal-Inn Freyung Grafenau. All of them offer their support and competence on the way to independence. 
Time for exchange and networking among students was also planned for the Founders’ Day. Five start-ups presented their ideas and some of them were still looking 
for fellow entrepreneurs. At the end of the event there was still knowledge about brand management and the opportunity to ask questions in small groups. Five start-ups 
presented their ideas and some of them were still looking for fellow entrepreneurs. -->
